Notes for creating structures with ChemDraw:

1. Draw structure in ChemBioDraw. Be sure to check the double bonds if you have a conjugated system to make sure they're where they should be. You can check this by forcing the hydrogens to be shown. Select the structure. Go to Structure->Atom Properties->Implicit Hydrogens->Not allowed. This will show all the hydrogens. If you have ones where you don't expect any, check your bonding.

2. Open Chem3D Pro

3. In ChemBioDraw, select the structure (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C).

4. Switch to Chem 3D Pro and paste (Ctrl+V). Your structure should appear in 3D.

5. Save file as a Gaussian *.gjf file.

6. Open the *.gjf file in Ampac and save as a *.dat file.
